# Example of a project ReadMe (User's guide)
Start with a simple description of what your project does. This here gives examples of 2 simple project file/folder structures: 
1) main.py: imports from the stuff module (the local stuff.py file)
2) run_testpak.py: uses a simple package (called testpak) that can be installed via pip. 

# Requirements
List anything that the user needs to have to be able to run your program. Be as version-specific as you can b/c this will nail down what __you__ used when it run for __you__, i.e. that the user can't expect it to work with older versions. It's ofc quite possible that this all should still work with newer versions.  
- Python 3.7 or higher
- [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)
- [dill](https://dill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dill.html) 0.3 or higher 

# Installation 
List what the user needs to do __before__ running your app 
for main.py
- use pip to install the required third party packages:  ` pip -r requirements.txt`

for run_testpak.py
- use `pip` to build and install testpack as a local package and install required packages
- open a OS terminal, go into the project root folder and type: `pip install .` (<- dot!)

# Usage
Describe how to run your app
- `main.py`: run it in the project root folder, so it can import from the testpack folder
- `testpak.py`: can be run from any folder once it's been installed locally

# Code Examples
If your project code is meant to be integrated into python code, you should list at least a few usage examples that can be copy/pasted and run. For more complex cases, consider writing a separate tutorial (put it and its code into a separate folder called tutorial).
Here, I'll just give one of the functions that my package defines:

```
# use the evenOdd function
from testpak import evenOdd
x = int(input("Enter a number:"))
print(x, "is",  evenOdd(x))
```

# Known issues
List any known bugs and limitations

# Acknowledgments
If some project was instrumental in helping you with this project, consider listing it here.

Note that images need to be referenced, i.e. you will need to put them into a separate folder, here I've put an image into my docs folder:
